 qng_banner_reform: "Eight Banners"
 qng_banner_reform_desc: "The $qng_banner_reform$ is a unique military and social organization system of the Qing Dynasty. The Eight Banners are divided into eight banners: Plain Yellow, Plain White, Plain Red, Plain Blue, Bordered Yellow, Bordered White, Bordered Red, and Bordered Blue, each consisting of several niru (companies). The Banner System is not only a military organization but also the foundation of Qing rule, ensuring the privileged status of Manchu nobles and soldiers while providing a strong source of levies."
